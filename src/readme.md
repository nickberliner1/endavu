**Installation**

In order to install and run this project locally, clone this repo into a directory of your choice. After doing so, run `npm install` to install all necessary dependencies.

Once everything has finished downloading, you're ready to run the app.

Navigate to the project if you aren't already on it with your terminal, and run `npm start`. This will start a local development server on your default browser at the url called `localhost:3000`.

After navigating to the url, a list of financial assets should be displayed. You can scroll through to see all of them, including some minor details about each asset, or click on one of them to expand the view and see more details.
