**Installation**

In order to install and run this project locally, clone or download this repo into a directory of your choice. After doing so, navigate to this project in your terminal and run `npm install` to install all necessary dependencies.

Once everything has finished downloading, you're ready to run the app.

Make sure you are still in the project in your terminal, and run `npm start`. This will start a local development server on your default browser at the url called `localhost:3000`.

After navigating to the url, a list of financial assets should be displayed. You can scroll through to see all of them, including some minor details about each asset, or click on one of them to expand the view and see more details.

You are also able to filter the assets by the country they are listed in, as well as sort them by name alphabetically.

-   Note: If the financial assets are not being displayed, there could be a problem with your internet connection. Please make sure you have a strong connection, and if you don't, you may just have to wait awhile until they load.
